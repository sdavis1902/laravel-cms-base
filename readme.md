# Laravel CMS Base

This is a very basic CMS build via Laravel.

AdminLTE theme for backend,
Auth via cartalyst/sentinel,
Twig support via [rcrow/TwigBridge](https://github.com/rcrowe/TwigBridge)  ( I like Twig better than Blade ),
Basic user management,
Basic bootstrap theme for frontend ( replace it with your own )

Just clone the repository and set up like you would set up any Laravel installation ( setup your .env, run migrations, composer install, setup your web server )

There are no users at the start, the first time you try to login, it will take the username and password you try to login with and create a first user based on that.
